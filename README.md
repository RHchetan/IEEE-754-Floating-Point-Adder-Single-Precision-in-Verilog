# IEEE-754-Floating-Point-Adder-Single-Precision-in-Verilog
Overview This project implements a 32-bit IEEE-754 Single-Precision Floating Point Adder using Verilog HDL. The module takes two 32-bit floating-point numbers (in IEEE-754 format) as inputs and computes their sum, also in IEEE-754 single-precision format.
